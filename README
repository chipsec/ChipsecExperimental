This is an experimental version of chipsec demonstrating potential areas of improvement

What Changed
  - Redesigned Configuration Loading
    - Uses pci enumeration and cpuid to identify matches within xml
    - Added a parsing library for core and custom configuration
    - Added a parent/child xml structure where a parent is the device identification and the child is the register configuration.
      - Devices can be mapped to multiple register configuration files
      - Multiple devices can be mapped to the same register configuration file
    - Redesigned Configurations
      - Removed instances of common.xml
      - Scoping was added to registers
        - A register is now defined by VID.DEVICE.REGISTERNAME
        - A set_scope function was added to keep naming the same
  - Integrated Bus support
    - By default register functionality will return all instances unless specified
    - The Register values returned are a list containing tuples of value and instance
  - Improved device and address space identification
    - Removed register conflicts due to duplicate names
      - A duplicate name within the same device will still override
    - An exception is thrown if a pci device is not valid or mmio/io space is 0
  - util_cmd clean-up
    - 90% of commands ported
    - Some have improved funtionality
  - Improved logging
    - Logging works closer to python logging
  - Decoupled Helper functionality
    - No longer driver and native funtions
    - Added ability to load appropriate helper within modules/commands
  - General Code cleanup and improvements
    - removed dead code
    - cleaned up api's and interfaces for consistency
